# COMP1000
Code from Macquarie University unit COMP1000 Introduction to Computer Programming unit, completed in session 2 2022. There was much more code but they were 
confined to the in class tutorials, however I still happened to download a few. The most notable project is the major work which is a little game. All code was written in
processing.
